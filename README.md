# Travel Planner using Dijkstra's Algorithm

<br>
This project is a Travel Planner application that leverages Data Structures and Algorithms to determine the most efficient route between a source and destination based on cost, time, and distance.
<br>
All the route and location data is stored in a MySQL database, ensuring smooth and dynamic data handling. To enhance user interaction, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed using JavaFX.

<br>
The core of the project is built on a graph data structure implemented using an adjacency list. The graph supports bidirectional connections between nodes, allowing accurate and flexible mapping of real-world routes.
